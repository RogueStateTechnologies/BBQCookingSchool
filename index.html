                    Over the past 22 years we have taught more than 2,300 students in groups and 
                    as individuals and have graduated the only 365 Certified Master BBQ Cooks (MBBQ) in the world.
                    The Master BBQ School is designed to help all cooks acquire new BBQ skills or improve their current outdoor cooking techniques.
                     The home-study course teaches the major BBQ cooking formats including direct/indirect grilling and slow-wood-smoke cooking. 
                     Students score their own cooking and appoint Personal BBQ Judges who also score the meats. 
                     Students must complete all 24 exercises and answer an open-book, True-or-False quiz for each of eight lessons. 
                     The Score Sheets, Quizzes and Exercise Reporting Forms are sent to us to evaluate. 
                     Completion of the course is required within one calendar year after we receive your first lesson. 
                     Graduates receive a Master BBQ Cook Certificate and a letter confirming their graduation.

                <p class="text body" id="testemonial">
                    I'm typing up this testimonial as I'm about an hour into smoking a 10 lb. 
                    Angus beef brisket using your beef brisket recipe -- which has produced the best briskets I have ever made! 
                    I started BBQing at a young age (10-12 years old) in Texas just after friends of our family invited us over and we ate smoked brisket 
                    for the first time. My father promptly had a welder cut an oil drum in half and make a BBQ that could indirectly smoke or grill on, 
                    upon which my father and I started our BBQ journey. I'm turning 65 now and although I've smoked plenty of great briskets, pork butts, 
                    ribs, etc., taking your class certainly kicked up my game and brought overall more consistency to my BBQing efforts. 
                    My key takeaway from your classes that increased my consistency was learning the times, 
                    temperatures and processes for the various meats and fish. 
                    I learned to monitor the temperature more -- rather than just using time and touch. 
                    The various brining techniques, etc., also elevated my game. 
                    I enjoyed the introductions to each chapter, which gave background and perspective to the following BBQ lessons, 
                    as well as the field assignments of comparison-shopping local meat markets and communicating more with the butchers 
                    to get the cuts and quality of meat you recommend. 
                    I highly recommend this course for anyone wanting to improve their BBQing techniques and results and expand their 
                    BBQing repertoire. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you certainly have, 
                    and I greatly appreciated that you sent me a copy of the brisket recipe from the course that I am using today, 
                    due to mine being packed away in storage from a recent move! 
                    I didn't fully complete your course due to a cross-country move due to a change of jobs, 
                    but I found it valuable enough that I'll probably pay to re-take and complete the course to officially become 
                    another of your Certified Master BBQ Cooks.

                    I learned that the size of the meat must be considered when smoking. 
                    Next time I will buy a smaller brisket for home. 
                    I would have liked to have seen more on the types and styles of grills and smokers available.

                    The course made me do additional research into things I found most interesting like the difference between meat grades. 
                    I liked the rub sections and wish there would have been more recipes for rubs and marinades. 
                    The ones I used were great. This is an actual ACF course and gave me much more expertise doing barbecuing and smoking.

                    The Master BBQ School has been specifically written to greatly improve the skills of the backyard barbecuer, 
                    the professional chef and the competitive cook or team. 
                    In fact, a past California State Champion and a Memphis In May Grand Champion have been students of our techniques. 
                    Of the 365 Certified Master BBQ Cooks (MBBQ) in the world, we have personally taught 364 of them. 
                    Like my fellow Marines, we are the Few and the Proud, culinarily.
                    The Master BBQ School is an eight-lesson correspondence course that you study at home using your own cooking equipment and 
                    at your own pace. You will need a grill and a dedicated smoker to take this course. 
                    Our training is based on in-the-pit, hands-on techniques designed to teach you the "What" and "Why" of direct and indirect grilling and
                    classic wood-smoked BBQ, not just how to put together recipes. 
                    At $299, most of our students say they have saved at least that much in the cost of meat that they have not overcooked 
                    or undercooked because of our precise instructions and techniques. 
                    After you know how to cook the meats, you add your own touches by varying the kinds of smoke wood, 
                    the brines, the rubs and sauces to get the flavor profile you and your folks like best.                    
                    You grade your own cooked meat and appoint an independent Personal BBQ Judge to also grade your cooking efforts 
                    according to Kansas City BBQ Society guidelines. The grades are sent to us to evaluate separately. 
                    Any large discrepancies in the grading will mean a telephone call from our faculty. 
                    You must also complete the reading assignments, the cooking exercises and the quizzes at the end of each of the 
                    eight lessons and snail mail, email or fax them to us for grading.  
                    If you are fairly studious, it should take about eight weeks to complete the entire course.
                    We are always available to answer questions and to assist students in making this course a truly terrific experience. 
                    Upon successful completion of the course, within one calendar year from the time you send us the first lesson, 
                    you will be awarded a Master BBQ Cook Certificate and a Letter of Graduation.  
                    Better than that, you will have mastered the major cooking techniques necessary to create world-class grilled and
                    barbecued pork, ribs, chicken, beef and other meats.  
                    American Culinary Federation (ACF) certified chefs will also earn 50 hours of Continuing Education Credit toward
                    re-certification. The Master BBQ School is the only home-study BBQ course that has received the federation's approval.
