                <p class="text body" id="testemonial">
                    I'm typing up this testimonial as I'm about an hour into smoking a 10 lb. 
                    Angus beef brisket using your beef brisket recipe -- which has produced the best briskets I have ever made! 
                    I started BBQing at a young age (10-12 years old) in Texas just after friends of our family invited us over and we ate smoked brisket 
                    for the first time. My father promptly had a welder cut an oil drum in half and make a BBQ that could indirectly smoke or grill on, 
                    upon which my father and I started our BBQ journey. I'm turning 65 now and although I've smoked plenty of great briskets, pork butts, 
                    ribs, etc., taking your class certainly kicked up my game and brought overall more consistency to my BBQing efforts. 
                    My key takeaway from your classes that increased my consistency was learning the times, 
                    temperatures and processes for the various meats and fish. 
                    I learned to monitor the temperature more -- rather than just using time and touch. 
                    The various brining techniques, etc., also elevated my game. 
                    I enjoyed the introductions to each chapter, which gave background and perspective to the following BBQ lessons, 
                    as well as the field assignments of comparison-shopping local meat markets and communicating more with the butchers 
                    to get the cuts and quality of meat you recommend. 
                    I highly recommend this course for anyone wanting to improve their BBQing techniques and results and expand their 
                    BBQing repertoire. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you certainly have, 
                    and I greatly appreciated that you sent me a copy of the brisket recipe from the course that I am using today, 
                    due to mine being packed away in storage from a recent move! 
                    I didn't fully complete your course due to a cross-country move due to a change of jobs, 
                    but I found it valuable enough that I'll probably pay to re-take and complete the course to officially become 
                    another of your Certified Master BBQ Cooks.

                <p class="text body" id="testemonial">
                    I learned that the size of the meat must be considered when smoking. 
                    Next time I will buy a smaller brisket for home. 
                    I would have liked to have seen more on the types and styles of grills and smokers available.

                <p class="text body" id="testemonial">
                    The course made me do additional research into things I found most interesting like the difference between meat grades. 
                    I liked the rub sections and wish there would have been more recipes for rubs and marinades. 
                    The ones I used were great. This is an actual ACF course and gave me much more expertise doing barbecuing and smoking.

                    I was really impressed with the brining applications for poultry and pork. 
                    I would like to have seen more recipes for brines. Very educational school, and very adaptive.
